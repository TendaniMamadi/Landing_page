            <p>I have a Building and Civil engineering background.
                I'm interested in knowing how the Greek managed to build houses
                that cling on a rock.
                It will give me more insights on engineering methods implemented.
                Not forgetting the ambience, beautiful view of the ocean and islands surrounding the city.</p>
